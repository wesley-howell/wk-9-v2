// Goal: Provide a function to "like" a post in Firebase
// Requirement: "Likes" are user-specific â€“ a user can "like" a post, but only once.
// Currently, the "number of likes" on a post isn't user-specific, nor does it prevent an
// unlimited number of likes. How would we expand/refactor our domain model to support this?

// allows us to use firebase
let firebase = require(`./firebase`)

exports.handler = async function(event) {

  // write the recipe and the implementation

  return {
    statusCode: 200
  }
}
